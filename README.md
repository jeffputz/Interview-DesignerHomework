# Interview-DesignerHomework

This shouldn't take long... we're mostly after your demonstrated ability to translate a visual comp into a deliverable. Please check the completehome.png and completeabout.png images to see what the pages should look like when finished. Here are the rules:

* You can't make changes to the HTML other than to add class or id attributes to the elements.
* You can't edit the images.
* Your Bootstrap references are already in place.
* Edit the stylesheet.css as desired. It has the font import already at the top.
* The result must be responsive. (Hint: Bootstrap does this for you, so don't fight it.)

When it's done, zip it, fileshare it, whatever you want, to get it to me.

Optional: If you're really ambitious, make a totally separate zip (i.e., you still have to deliver by the above rules), and style it in any way you would like, telling a visual story that goes with the images.
